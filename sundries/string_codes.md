# Strings and string codes

Strings in NewGRF files are in one of two basic formats: Latin-1 and UTF8. 

- Latin-1 strings contain only characters that are found in English and a few other languages: each character is one byte.

- UTF8 strings can contains any characters (code points) from the Basic Multilingual Plane, and can be used to represent any unicode string: each code point is two bytes, and is encoded in UTF8 as a series of one or more bytes. 

Where NFO and NML require an upper case thorn character (`"Ãž"`) at the beginning to indicate that a string is encoded in UTF8, **yagl** makes this determination automatically. **yagl** internally treats evert string as if it might need to be encoded as UTF8, but then checks whether it actually contains any characters that would actually require this encoding. The thorn is prepended to UTF8 encoded strings as OpenTTD expects.

Strings may contain control codes to alter the text colour and to do a number of other things. All the control codes are entered into the string in a human-readable format escaped with braces. For example `"Hello, {new-line}World!"` and `"{red}Red text, {white}White text and {blue}Blue text."`. Some control codes obtain values from an in-game stack, but this does not affect the strings in YAGL. A few control codes have one or two arguments, which are entered as byte values follow the name of the code. The following sections list all the permitted control codes.

A couple of special cases:

- Strings are delimited by double quotes in YAGL. If you actually want a double quote character inside your string, use the code `"{dq}"`. It's code point value is 0x22, which is the Latin-1 and UTF8 code for a double quote character.

- Control codes are delimited by braces in YAGL. If you actually want braces inside your string, use the sequence `"{{"` where you want a single `"{"`. This prevents the open brace being treated as the start of a control code, and the closing brace, if any, will be treated as a normal character. Braces cannot be used in Latin-1 strings because their code point values are 0x7B and 0x7D, which are already assigned to other control codes. They print regular glyphs for UTF8 strings, so **yagl** forces strings containing braces to be encoded as UTF8.

## Control codes

Any arguments are placed inside the braces with name of the control code. For example, `"{xy-offs 0x10 0x12}"`.
